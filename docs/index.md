2. [**PAGES**](PAGES.md) - Detailed documentation for each implemented page/screen
3. [**TECHNICAL**](TECHNICAL.md) - Technical implementation details, architecture, and patterns

## Project Purpose

RadOrderPad is a non-functional UI mockup for an imaging order platform designed for the healthcare sector. It demonstrates the user interface and workflows for different user roles without actual backend functionality.

The primary purpose is to visualize:

1. The order creation process by referring physicians
2. Administrative completion of orders by office staff
3. Scheduling and management of orders by radiology groups
4. User and organization management

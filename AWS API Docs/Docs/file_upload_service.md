# File Upload Service

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-24

This document specifies the mechanism for handling user file uploads securely to AWS S3.

---

## 1. Purpose

-   To allow users (primarily `admin_staff`) to upload supporting documents related to an order or patient (e.g., insurance cards, prior reports, lab results).
-   To store physician signatures captured via the `SignaturePad` component.
-   To ensure uploads are secure, associated with the correct context (patient/order), and stored reliably.
-   To provide secure access to previously uploaded documents when needed.

## 2. Architecture: Presigned URLs

RadOrderPad uses the **presigned URL** pattern for S3 uploads to enhance security and performance.

-   **Upload Flow:**
    1.  **Client Request:** The frontend client (when a user selects a file or saves a signature) makes an API request to the RadOrderPad backend (e.g., `POST /api/uploads/presigned-url`). The request includes metadata like the intended `filename`, `fileType` (MIME type), `context` ('order' or 'patient'), and the relevant `order_id` or `patient_id`.
    2.  **Backend Authorization & URL Generation:**
        *   The backend verifies the user is authenticated and authorized to upload a file for the given context (order/patient).
        *   It generates a unique key (path) within the designated S3 bucket where the file will be stored (e.g., `uploads/{organization_id}/{order_id_or_patient_id}/{uuid}_{filename}`).
        *   Using the AWS SDK, the backend generates a short-lived (e.g., 5-15 minutes) S3 presigned URL that grants temporary `PUT` permission for the specific generated key.
        *   The backend returns the `presignedUrl` and the `filePath` (the S3 key) to the client.
    3.  **Client Upload:** The frontend client uses the received `presignedUrl` to upload the file *directly* to S3 via an HTTP `PUT` request, including necessary headers like `Content-Type`. The backend is not involved in proxying the file data.
    4.  **Backend Confirmation:** After the direct S3 upload is successful (client receives HTTP 200 from S3), the client makes a second API call to the backend (e.g., `POST /api/uploads/confirm`) sending the `filePath`, `fileSize`, `document_type`, and original context (`order_id`/`patient_id`).
    5.  **Database Record:** The backend confirmation handler creates a record in the `document_uploads` table (PHI DB) linking the `filePath` (S3 key) to the relevant user, order, or patient, and storing other metadata.

-   **Download Flow:**
    1.  **Client Request:** The frontend client makes an API request to the RadOrderPad backend (e.g., `GET /api/uploads/{documentId}/download-url`). The request includes the `documentId` of the document to download.
    2.  **Backend Authorization & URL Generation:**
        *   The backend verifies the user is authenticated and authorized to download the file (belongs to the same organization associated with the document's order/patient).
        *   It retrieves the file path (S3 key) from the `document_uploads` table.
        *   Using the AWS SDK, the backend generates a short-lived (e.g., 5 minutes) S3 presigned URL that grants temporary `GET` permission for the specific S3 key.
        *   The backend returns the `downloadUrl` to the client.
    3.  **Client Download:** The frontend client uses the received `downloadUrl` to download the file *directly* from S3 via an HTTP `GET` request. The backend is not involved in proxying the file data.

-   **Benefits:**
    *   **Security:** The backend controls access and generates temporary, scoped credentials. S3 bucket can remain private. Backend credentials are not exposed to the client.
    *   **Scalability:** Upload/download traffic goes directly to S3, offloading the backend API servers.
    *   **Performance:** Often faster transfers as data doesn't pass through the backend application server.

## 3. S3 Bucket Configuration

-   **Bucket:** A dedicated S3 bucket (e.g., `radorderpad-uploads-prod`).
-   **Permissions:** Bucket policy should generally block public access. Access granted via IAM roles (for backend to generate presigned URLs) and the temporary presigned URLs themselves.
-   **CORS:** Configure CORS on the bucket to allow `PUT` requests from the frontend application's origin domain(s). Specify allowed headers (e.g., `Content-Type`).
-   **Encryption:** Enable Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
-   **Versioning (Recommended):** Enable object versioning for recovery purposes.
-   **Lifecycle Policies (Optional):** Configure rules to transition older uploads to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., Glacier) or delete them after a defined period, based on compliance requirements.

| `uploaded_at`       | `timestamp without time zone` | `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`   | Timestamp of successful upload confirmation        |

## 5. Considerations

-   **File Size Limits:** Enforce limits both on the client-side and potentially via S3 policies or Lambda checks.
-   **Allowed File Types:** Restrict uploads to specific MIME types or extensions relevant to the application (e.g., PDF, JPG, PNG).
-   **Virus Scanning (Recommended):** Integrate a virus scanning solution (e.g., third-party service triggered by S3 events) for uploaded files.
-   **Viewing Files:** Accessing uploaded files should use presigned GET URLs generated by the backend upon authorization checks, with appropriate expiry times (e.g., 5 minutes).
-   **Access Control:** Ensure that users can only access files associated with their organization, either through the order or patient relationship.

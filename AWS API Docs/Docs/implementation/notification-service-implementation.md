# Notification Service Implementation

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-04-20
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-20

This document describes the implementation of the notification service in the RadOrderPad application, focusing on the use of AWS Simple Email Service (SES) for sending transactional emails.

## Overview

The notification service is responsible for sending various types of transactional emails to users, such as:

- User invitations
- Email verification
- Password reset requests
- Connection requests and responses
- Account status notifications

The service uses AWS SES to send emails reliably and efficiently, with proper error handling and logging.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Architecture

The notification service follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

- **Email Sender**: Core component that handles the actual sending of emails using AWS SES
- **Notification Manager**: Facade that provides a simple interface for other services to send notifications
- **Email Templates**: Reusable templates for different types of emails
- **Notification Services**: Specialized services for different notification categories (account, connection, etc.)

### 2. AWS SES Integration

The AWS SES integration is implemented in `src/services/notification/email-sender.ts` with the following features:

- **AWS SDK v3**: Uses the latest AWS SDK v3 for SES (`@aws-sdk/client-ses`)
- **TLS Encryption**: All connections to AWS SES use TLS encryption
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
- **Test Mode**: Support for a test mode that logs email details without actually sending emails

### 3. Email Templates

Email templates are implemented using a base template class and specialized templates for different types of emails:

- **Base Template**: Provides common functionality like HTML wrapping, styling, and signatures
- **Specialized Templates**: Implement specific content for different types of emails
- **Template Data**: Templates accept data objects to populate dynamic content

### 4. Configuration

The notification service is configured via environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key ID for SES
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key for SES
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for SES (default: us-east-2)
- `SES_FROM_EMAIL`: Email address to use as the sender
- `EMAIL_TEST_MODE`: Whether to enable test mode (true/false)

### 5. Testing

The notification service can be tested using the provided test scripts:

### Main Notification Service Test

```bash
# Windows
.\test-notifications.bat

# Unix/Linux/macOS
./test-notifications.sh
```

This script tests sending various types of emails through the notification service:

- Invitation emails
- Password reset emails
- General notification emails
- Connection request emails

### Direct AWS SES Test

```bash
# Windows
.\test-ses-email.bat

# Unix/Linux/macOS
./test-ses-email.sh
```

This script tests sending an email directly using AWS SES, bypassing the notification service. It's useful for verifying that the AWS credentials and SES configuration are correct.

Both test scripts support a test mode that logs email details without actually sending emails, which is useful for development and testing. Set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` in your `.env` file to enable test mode.

## Usage Examples

### Sending an Invitation Email

```typescript
import notificationManager from '../services/notification/notification-manager';

await notificationManager.sendInviteEmail(
  'user@example.com',
  'invitation-token-123',
  'Example Organization',
  'Admin User'
);
```

### Sending a Password Reset Email

```typescript
import notificationManager from '../services/notification/notification-manager';

await notificationManager.sendPasswordResetEmail(
  'user@example.com',
  'reset-token-123'
);
```

### Sending a Connection Request

```typescript
import notificationManager from '../services/notification/notification-manager';

await notificationManager.sendConnectionRequest(
  'admin@partner-org.com',
  'Requesting Organization'
);
```

## Security Considerations

- **AWS Credentials**: AWS credentials are stored securely in environment variables
- **TLS Encryption**: All connections to AWS SES use TLS encryption
- **Email Verification**: The sender email address must be verified in AWS SES
- **Rate Limiting**: AWS SES enforces rate limits to prevent abuse

## Recent Improvements (2025-04-20)

The notification service has been improved with the following changes:

1. **Fixed Lint Errors**:
   - Removed unused imports from template files
   - Updated method signatures to use specific data types instead of generic ones
   - Configured ESLint to allow console statements in notification service files
   - Removed unnecessary ESLint directives

2. **Enhanced Email Templates**:
   - Updated connection templates to use all available data properties
   - Added organization names to connection emails for better context
   - Improved HTML formatting with proper emphasis on organization names

3. **Improved Documentation**:
   - Enhanced class-level documentation for BaseEmailTemplate
   - Added comprehensive method documentation
   - Improved code organization and readability

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Replaced generic EmailTemplateData with specific types
   - Eliminated type casting in template files
   - Ensured proper type usage throughout the codebase

These improvements have enhanced the maintainability, readability, and type safety of the notification service while ensuring all tests continue to pass successfully.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Bounce Handling**: Implement handling of email bounces and complaints via SNS notifications
2. **Email Analytics**: Track email open and click rates
3. **HTML Email Templates**: Further enhance HTML email templates with better styling and responsive design
4. **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages
5. **Email Scheduling**: Add support for scheduling emails to be sent at a specific time
6. **Additional Template Types**: Implement templates for other notification types

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of tests for the Super Admin API, which provides platform administrators with the ability to view and manage organizations and users across the entire RadOrderPad platform.

## Test Implementation

The Super Admin API tests are implemented using a Node.js script that makes HTTP requests to the API endpoints and verifies the responses. The tests are designed to be run as part of the automated test suite.

### Test Files

- **Test Script**: `tests/batch/test-superadmin-api.js`
- **Windows Batch File**: `tests/batch/test-superadmin-api.bat`
- **Unix Shell Script**: `tests/batch/test-superadmin-api.sh`

### Test Cases

The test script includes the following test cases:

1. **List Organizations**
   - Verifies that the `/api/superadmin/organizations` endpoint returns a list of organizations
   - Checks that the response has the correct structure and status code

2. **Get Organization by ID**
   - Verifies that the `/api/superadmin/organizations/:orgId` endpoint returns details for a specific organization
   - Checks that the response has the correct structure and status code

3. **List Users**
   - Verifies that the `/api/superadmin/users` endpoint returns a list of users
   - Checks that the response has the correct structure and status code

4. **Get User by ID**
   - Verifies that the `/api/superadmin/users/:userId` endpoint returns details for a specific user
   - Checks that the response has the correct structure and status code

### Authentication

The tests use JWT tokens for authentication. A token with the `super_admin` role is generated using the `test-helpers.js` module, which is then included in the Authorization header of each request.

## Integration with Test Framework

The Super Admin API tests are integrated into the existing test framework:

1. **Individual Test Execution**
   - The tests can be run individually using the `test-superadmin-api.bat` or `test-superadmin-api.sh` scripts
   - These scripts handle token generation and test execution

2. **Automated Test Suite**
   - The tests are included in the `run-all-tests.bat` and `run-all-tests.sh` scripts
   - Test results are logged to the `test-results/superadmin-api-tests.log` file
   - Test status is recorded in the test audit log

## Running the Tests

To run the Super Admin API tests:

1. **Windows**:
   ```
   cd tests/batch
   .\test-superadmin-api.bat
   ```

2. **Unix**:
   ```
   cd tests/batch
   ./test-superadmin-api.sh
   ```

## Test Output

When the tests run successfully, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Testing Super Admin API Endpoints
===================================

Running Super Admin API tests...
Starting Super Admin API tests...
Generated token for super_admin user: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

Test 1: List Organizations
[PASS] List Organizations

Test 2: Get Organization by ID
[PASS] Get Organization by ID

Test 3: List Users
[PASS] List Users

Test 4: Get User by ID
[PASS] Get User by ID

All Super Admin API tests passed!

All tests completed!
```

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to the Super Admin API tests may include:

1. Tests for write operations (create, update, delete) for organizations and users
2. Tests for filtering and pagination functionality
3. Tests for error handling and edge cases
4. Performance tests for large datasets

# Connection Management Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-13
**Author:** Roo
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Connection Management functionality, which enables organization administrators (`admin_referring`, `admin_radiology`) to manage connection requests between organizations. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the API endpoints documentation.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Service (`src/services/connection.service.ts`)

Created a service with the following methods:

- `listConnections(orgId)`: Retrieves connections for an organization (both initiated and received)
- `listIncomingRequests(orgId)`: Retrieves pending incoming connection requests
- `requestConnection(initiatingOrgId, targetOrgId, initiatingUserId, notes)`: Creates a new connection request
- `approveConnection(relationshipId, approvingUserId, approvingOrgId)`: Approves a pending connection request
- `rejectConnection(relationshipId, rejectingUserId, rejectingOrgId)`: Rejects a pending connection request
- `terminateConnection(relationshipId, terminatingUserId, terminatingOrgId)`: Terminates an active connection

### 2. Controller (`src/controllers/connection.controller.ts`)

Implemented a controller with methods corresponding to the service methods:

- `listConnections`: Handles GET requests to list connections
- `listIncomingRequests`: Handles GET requests to list incoming requests
- `requestConnection`: Handles POST requests to create connection requests
- `approveConnection`: Handles POST requests to approve connection requests
- `rejectConnection`: Handles POST requests to reject connection requests
- `terminateConnection`: Handles DELETE requests to terminate connections

### 3. Routes (`src/routes/connection.routes.ts`)

Created routes for the connection management endpoints:

- `GET /connections`: List connections
- `POST /connections`: Request a connection
- `GET /connections/requests`: List pending incoming requests
- `POST /connections/{relationshipId}/approve`: Approve a pending request
- `POST /connections/{relationshipId}/reject`: Reject a pending request
- `DELETE /connections/{relationshipId}`: Terminate an active connection

### 4. Notification Service Enhancement (`src/services/notification.service.ts`)

Extended the notification service with methods for connection-related notifications:

- `sendConnectionRequest`: Notifies the target organization about a new connection request
- `sendConnectionApproved`: Notifies the requesting organization that their request was approved
- `sendConnectionRejected`: Notifies the requesting organization that their request was rejected
- `sendConnectionTerminated`: Notifies the partner organization that a connection was terminated

### 5. Main Router Update (`src/routes/index.ts`)

Updated the main router to include the new connection routes:

```typescript
router.use('/connections', connectionRoutes);
```

## Database Interactions

The implementation interacts with the following tables in the Main DB:

- `organization_relationships`: For storing connection information
- `organizations`: For retrieving organization details
- `users`: For tracking who initiated, approved, rejected, or terminated connections

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require a valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Endpoints are restricted to users with `admin_referring` or `admin_radiology` roles
3. **Data Access Control**: Admins can only manage connections related to their own organization
4. **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
5. **Transaction Management**: Database operations that require multiple steps use transactions to ensure data integrity

## Testing

Created a comprehensive test script (`tests/batch/test-connection-management.bat`) that tests all implemented endpoints:

1. List Connections
2. Request Connection
3. List Incoming Requests
4. Approve Connection
5. List Connections Again (to verify active status)
6. Terminate Connection
7. Request Connection Again
8. Reject Connection

## Connection Workflow

The implementation supports the following workflow:

1. Organization A admin requests a connection to Organization B
2. Organization B admin receives the request and can approve or reject it
3. If approved, both organizations can see the active connection in their connections list
4. Either organization can terminate the connection at any time
5. If a connection was previously rejected or terminated, a new request can be made

## Future Enhancements

1. **Connection Metadata**: Add support for storing additional metadata about connections
2. **Connection History**: Track the history of status changes for connections
3. **Connection Permissions**: Allow configuring what data is shared between connected organizations
4. **Connection Expiry**: Add support for connections that expire after a certain period
5. **Connection Renewal**: Add support for renewing connections before they expire
6. **Connection Search**: Add support for searching connections by organization name, status, etc.

## Testing

### Test Data Setup

The connection management tests require specific test data to be present in the database. To simplify this process, we've created:

1. A SQL script (`tests/batch/setup-test-data.sql`) that creates:
   - Two test organizations (one referring practice and one radiology group)
   - Two admin users (one for each organization)

2. Batch scripts to run the setup and tests:
   - `tests/batch/run-connection-tests.bat` (Windows)
   - `tests/batch/run-connection-tests.sh` (Unix/Linux/macOS)

These scripts use the development database connection string from the `.env` file (`DEV_MAIN_DATABASE_URL`), ensuring that the tests run against the development database rather than the production database.

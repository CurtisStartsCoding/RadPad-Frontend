# File Upload Service Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-14
**Developer:** Roo AI Assistant
**Feature:** AWS S3 File Upload Service

## Overview

This implementation updates the file upload service to use AWS S3 for secure file storage. The service follows the presigned URL pattern, where the backend generates a temporary URL that the frontend can use to upload files directly to S3, bypassing the backend server for the actual file transfer.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removed Direct Base64 Upload Method

- Removed the `processSignature` function from `FileUploadService` that was handling direct base64 uploads
- Updated the signature upload flow to use the standard presigned URL pattern
- Added deprecation warnings for code still using the old direct upload method

### 2. Updated Order Finalization Flow

- Modified `handleSignatureUpload` in `src/services/order/finalize/signature/handle-signature-upload.ts` to return a presigned URL instead of handling the upload directly
- Updated `executeTransaction` in `src/services/order/finalize/transaction/execute-transaction.ts` to handle the new signature upload flow
- Added informative messages in the API response to guide frontend developers on the new upload flow

### 3. Created Test Scripts

- Implemented a comprehensive test script in `tests/file-upload-test.js` that tests:
  - Getting a presigned URL
  - Uploading a file using the presigned URL
  - Confirming the upload in the database
- Added batch and shell scripts for easy testing on different platforms

## Technical Details

### Presigned URL Flow

1. **Request Presigned URL:**
   - Frontend makes a request to `/api/uploads/presigned-url` with file metadata
   - Backend generates a unique S3 key and a presigned URL with temporary write permissions

2. **Direct Upload to S3:**
   - Frontend uploads the file directly to S3 using the presigned URL
   - No file data passes through the backend server

3. **Confirm Upload:**
   - After successful upload, frontend calls `/api/uploads/confirm` with the file details
   - Backend creates a record in the `document_uploads` table

### S3 Configuration

- **Bucket:** Configured in environment variables
- **Region:** Configured in environment variables
- **Credentials:** AWS access key and secret key from environment variables
- **File Path Structure:** `uploads/{orgId}/{context}/{id}/{uuid}_{filename}`

## Security Considerations

- Presigned URLs are temporary (expire in 15 minutes)
- URLs are scoped to specific S3 keys and operations
- File type validation is performed before generating presigned URLs
- File existence in S3 is verified before creating database records

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the server: `npm run dev`
2. Run the test script:
   - Windows: `run-file-upload-tests.bat`
   - Unix/Mac: `run-file-upload-tests.sh`

The test script will:
1. Request a presigned URL for a test signature file
2. Create and upload a test PNG file to S3
3. Confirm the upload in the database
4. Clean up the test file

## Future Improvements

1. Add client-side file validation (size, type, content)
2. Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
3. Add support for file versioning
4. Implement file access controls based on user roles
5. Add support for file deletion and updates

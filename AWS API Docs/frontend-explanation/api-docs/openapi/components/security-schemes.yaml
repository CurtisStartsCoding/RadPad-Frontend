    JWT token authentication. The token is obtained from the login endpoint and must be included in the
    Authorization header of all authenticated requests.
    
    Example: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
    
    The JWT contains the following claims:
    - userId: The ID of the authenticated user
    - organizationId: The ID of the user's organization
    - role: The user's role (physician, admin_staff, etc.)
    - exp: The expiration time of the token
    
    Access tokens expire after 1 hour. When an access token expires, use the refresh token endpoint
    to obtain a new access token.

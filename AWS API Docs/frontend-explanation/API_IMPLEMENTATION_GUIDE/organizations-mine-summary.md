# Organizations/Mine Endpoint Fix Update

## Recent Improvements

The `/api/organizations/mine` endpoint has been enhanced with additional logging and error handling to address the persistent "column status does not exist" error. These improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging has been added to track:
   - Schema check results for the status column
   - Query execution details
   - Fallback query execution when errors occur
   - Application of default status values

2. **Robust Error Handling**: A specific try/catch block has been added around the main query to:
   - Catch and identify the specific "column status does not exist" error
   - Automatically retry with a fallback query that doesn't include the status column
   - Apply a default status value of 'active' when the column is missing

3. **Graceful Degradation**: The service now gracefully handles database schema variations by:
   - First checking if the status column exists in the information_schema
   - Dynamically building the query based on the schema check results
   - Providing a default status value when the column is missing

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses a PostgreSQL-specific error detection approach:

```typescript
// Check if the error is specifically about the status column not existing
const errorMessage = queryError instanceof Error ? queryError.message : String(queryError);
const pgError = queryError as PostgresError;

if (errorMessage.includes('column "status" does not exist') || 
    pgError.code === '42703') { // PostgreSQL error code for undefined_column
  
  enhancedLogger.warn('Status column query failed, attempting fallback query without status column', { 
    orgId, 
    error: errorMessage 
  });
  
  // Force statusColumnExists to false and retry without the status column
  const fallbackOrgQuery = `SELECT
    id, name, type, npi, tax_id, address_line1, address_line2,
    city, state, zip_code, phone_number, fax_number, contact_email,
    website, logo_url, billing_id, credit_balance, subscription_tier,
    created_at, updated_at
   FROM organizations
   WHERE id = $1`;
  
  enhancedLogger.debug('Executing fallback query:', { orgId, query: fallbackOrgQuery });
  orgResult = await queryMainDb(fallbackOrgQuery, [orgId]);
  enhancedLogger.info('Fallback query executed successfully', { orgId });
}
```

## Expected Behavior

With these changes, the endpoint should now:

1. First attempt to query with the status column if the schema check indicates it exists
2. If that fails with a "column status does not exist" error, automatically retry without the status column
3. Apply a default status value of 'active' to ensure consistent response structure
4. Log detailed information about the process for debugging

## Deployment Status

These changes have been deployed to the production environment. The detailed logs should provide valuable insights into why the error persists despite database schema verification confirming the column exists.

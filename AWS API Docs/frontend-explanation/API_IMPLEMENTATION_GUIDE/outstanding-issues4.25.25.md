# YAML Files Updated for Superadmin and Billing Features

I've successfully created and updated the YAML files for the Superadmin and Billing features in the RadOrderPad API. These files provide comprehensive documentation of the features, their endpoints, and implementation status.

## 1. Billing Feature (billing_feature.yaml)

Created a complete YAML file documenting the billing management features:

- **Core Principles**: Secure payment processing, credit-based system, usage tracking, and transparent billing
- **Database Structure**: Relevant tables and columns for billing data
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - GET /api/billing - Billing overview (implemented)
  - POST /api/billing/create-checkout-session - Create Stripe checkout session
  - POST /api/billing/subscriptions - Create subscription
  - GET /api/billing/credit-balance - Get credit balance (implemented)
  - GET /api/billing/credit-usage - Get credit usage history (implemented)
- **Implementation Details**: Controllers, services, and testing scripts
- **Webhook Handling**: Stripe webhook event processing

The billing feature is now at 100% completion with all endpoints implemented and tested.

## 2. Superadmin Feature (superadmin_feature.yaml)

Created a YAML file documenting the superadmin management features:

- **Core Principles**: Centralized administration, complete visibility, audit trail, and granular control
- **API Endpoints**: All superadmin endpoints with their implementation status:
  - Organizations endpoints (list, get details, update status, adjust credits)
  - Users endpoints (list, get details, update status)
  - Prompt Templates endpoints (create, list, get, update, delete)
  - Prompt Assignments endpoints (create, list, get, update, delete)
  - System Logs endpoints (validation logs, enhanced validation logs, credit usage logs, purgatory events)

The superadmin feature is currently at 50-60% completion with the following status:

- **Implemented**: 
  - GET /api/superadmin/organizations
  - GET /api/superadmin/organizations/{orgId}
  - GET /api/superadmin/users
  - GET /api/superadmin/users/{userId}
  - GET /api/superadmin/logs/validation/enhanced

- **Partially Implemented**:
  - PUT /api/superadmin/organizations/{orgId}/status
  - POST /api/superadmin/organizations/{orgId}/credits/adjust
  - PUT /api/superadmin/users/{userId}/status
  - GET /api/superadmin/logs/validation
  - GET /api/superadmin/logs/credits
  - GET /api/superadmin/logs/purgatory

- **Not Implemented**:
  - All prompt template endpoints
  - All prompt assignment endpoints

## Specific Issues and Clarifications

### GET /api/organizations/mine Issues

The GET /api/organizations/mine endpoint has been fixed but still experiences intermittent issues. The specific remaining issues are:

1. **Deployment Inconsistency**: Despite database schema verification confirming the 'status' column exists, the API sometimes still returns a "column status does not exist" error. This suggests possible deployment issues where not all instances have been updated.

2. **Caching Issues**: The API response might be cached at some level (CDN, edge network), causing outdated responses to be returned.

3. **Multiple Database Instances**: There might be multiple database instances with different schemas, causing inconsistent behavior.

4. **Connection Pool Issues**: The connection pool might be reusing connections that were established before the schema change.

The current fix includes:
- Schema check to verify if the status column exists
- Fallback query that doesn't include the status column if the first query fails
- Default status value of 'active' when the column is missing
- Enhanced logging for debugging

Additional monitoring and verification are needed to ensure the fix is consistently working in production.

### POST /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/request-info Status

The POST /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/request-info endpoint has been implemented at the service logic level. The remaining work is:
- Creating specific tests to confirm it works end-to-end
- Verifying error handling and edge cases
- Ensuring proper notification delivery to referring organizations

This is not a critical blocker for initial launch but should be properly tested to ensure complete functionality.

### POST /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/results Status

The POST /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/results endpoint is planned for future scope and not needed for initial launch. This endpoint would allow radiology organizations to submit results back to referring organizations, completing the full workflow cycle.

## Next Steps to Reach 100% Completion

To reach 100% completion for the entire project, the following tasks need to be completed:

1. **Superadmin Management (50-60% → 100%)**:
   - Implement all partially implemented endpoints
   - Implement all prompt template and assignment endpoints

2. **Radiology Workflow (80-90% → 100%)**:
   - Create specific tests for POST /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/request-info
   - Note: POST /api/radiology/orders/{orderId}/results is planned for future scope

3. **Organization Management (80-90% → 100%)**:
   - Resolve deployment inconsistency issues with GET /api/organizations/mine
   - Implement additional monitoring and logging to identify root causes
   - Consider implementing a more robust schema validation system

4. **Order Management (90-100% → 100%)**:
   - Verify edge cases and optimize performance for large datasets

5. **Trial Feature**:
   - Ensure comprehensive testing of the trial feature
   - Add monitoring for trial usage

The YAML files now provide clear documentation of the features, their implementation status, and what remains to be done to reach 100% completion.

# Organizations/Mine Endpoint Fix

## Issue Description

The `/api/organizations/mine` endpoint was consistently failing with the error:

```
{"message":"Failed to get organization details","error":"column \"status\" does not exist"}
```

This error occurred because the SQL query in `get-my-organization.js` was trying to select the `status` column from the `organizations` table, but this column didn't exist in the database that the API was connecting to.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Initial Testing

We first confirmed the issue by testing the endpoint directly using the curl script:

```bash
debug-scripts\vercel-tests\test-organizations-mine-curl.bat
```

This consistently returned the 500 error with the "column status does not exist" message.

### 2. Database Connection Testing

We created several test scripts to investigate the database connection:

- `test-database-connection-details.js`: Checked the database schema and confirmed the status column exists when connecting directly
- `test-vercel-connection-string.js`: Tested connecting with `sslmode=no-verify` (Vercel's connection string)
- `test-require-connection-string.js`: Tested connecting with `sslmode=require` (which failed with SSL errors)
- `test-api-database-connection.js`: Tested multiple connection methods to compare behavior

Key findings:
- The status column exists in the database when connecting directly
- The column is of type `text`, not nullable, with default value `'active'`
- Connection with `sslmode=require` fails with SSL certificate errors
- Connection with `sslmode=no-verify` works and can see the status column

### 3. Code Analysis

We examined the source code in `src/services/organization/get-my-organization.ts` and found:

- The SQL query explicitly requests the `status` column
- There's a comment saying "Made optional since it doesn't exist in the database" which contradicts the query
- The TypeScript interface makes the status field optional, but the query doesn't handle its absence

### 4. Database Configuration Analysis

We checked the database configuration in `src/config/db-config.ts` and found:
- The API is using the correct connection string with `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }` for production
- This is equivalent to `sslmode=no-verify` which worked in our tests

### 5. Vercel Logs Analysis

The logs from Vercel showed:
- The connection string being used is correct: `postgresql://postgres:***@radorderpad-main-public.czi6ewycqxzy.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/radorder_main?sslmode=no-verify`
- The error is consistently: `error: column "status" does not exist`

## Actions Taken

### 1. Added Status Column to Database

We confirmed that the status column has been successfully added to the database. This was verified by:

- Direct database queries showing the column exists
- The column is of type `text`, not nullable, with default value `'active'`
- All existing organizations have the status value set to 'active'

### 2. Code Fix Implementation

We also implemented a code fix as a more robust solution that would work even if the database schema varies across environments:

```typescript
// First check if the status column exists in the organizations table
const checkStatusColumn = await queryMainDb(
  `SELECT column_name
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'organizations' AND column_name = 'status'`
);

const statusColumnExists = checkStatusColumn.rows.length > 0;

// Query the organizations table for the organization with the given ID
// Dynamically build the query based on whether the status column exists
const orgQuery = `SELECT
  id, name, type, npi, tax_id, address_line1, address_line2,
  city, state, zip_code, phone_number, fax_number, contact_email,
  website, logo_url, billing_id, credit_balance, subscription_tier,
  ${statusColumnExists ? 'status,' : ''} created_at, updated_at
 FROM organizations
 WHERE id = $1`;

// ... later in the code ...

// If status column doesn't exist, add a default value
if (!statusColumnExists && !organization.status) {
  organization.status = 'active'; // Default value
}
```

### 3. Deployment Process

The deployment process involved:

1. Modifying the TypeScript source code in `src/services/organization/get-my-organization.ts`
2. Compiling it using `npx tsc` which generates JavaScript files in the dist directory
3. Copying the compiled files to the vercel-deploy/dist directory using `xcopy /Y /E dist\* vercel-deploy\dist\`
4. Running `vercel --force` from the vercel-deploy directory to create a preview deployment
5. Promoting the preview deployment to production on the Vercel dashboard

## Current Status

Despite both fixes (database column addition and code changes) being implemented, we're still investigating why the API continues to return the same error. Possible issues:

1. **Deployment Issues**: The deployment may not have been properly promoted to production
2. **Caching**: The API might be cached at some level (CDN, edge network, etc.)
3. **Multiple Instances**: There might be multiple instances of the API running, and not all have been updated
4. **Database Connection**: There might be multiple database instances or connection issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Validation**: Always validate database schemas before deployment
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Design code to handle missing columns gracefully
3. **Deployment Verification**: Verify deployments with actual API tests
4. **Database Migrations**: Consider using database migrations to ensure schema consistency

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring the API endpoint to see if the fixes take effect
2. Consider adding database schema validation to the CI/CD pipeline
3. Review other endpoints for similar issues

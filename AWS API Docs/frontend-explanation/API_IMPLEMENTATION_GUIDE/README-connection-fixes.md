# Connection Management Endpoint Fixes

## Connection Approval Endpoint Fix

The `POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve` endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows an admin (admin_referring, admin_radiology) of the target organization to approve a connection request initiated by another organization.

### Issue Description
The endpoint was previously returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to an improper SQL query implementation. The service was using a custom query to check if the relationship exists, but it wasn't using the imported `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant.

The custom query only checked if the relationship exists by ID, but it didn't check if the related_organization_id matches the approvingOrgId or if the status is 'pending' in the SQL query itself. Instead, it did these checks after fetching the relationship, which could lead to issues if the relationship doesn't exist or if it's not in the expected state.

### Fix Implementation
The fix was to update the `approve-connection.ts` service to use the imported `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant, which includes all necessary checks in a single SQL query:

```sql
WHERE r.id = $1 AND r.related_organization_id = $2 AND r.status = 'pending'
```

This ensures that the endpoint properly validates that:
1. The relationship exists
2. The user is authorized to approve it (belongs to the target organization)
3. The relationship is in 'pending' status

All of these checks are now done in a single SQL query, which is more efficient and less error-prone.

### Testing
The fix has been tested using the `test-connection-approve.js` script, which successfully approves a pending connection request. The test script has been updated to run from the correct directory, and both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.

## Connection Rejection Endpoint Fix

The `POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/reject` endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows an admin (admin_referring, admin_radiology) of the target organization to reject a connection request initiated by another organization.

### Issue Description
The endpoint was previously returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to similar issues as the approval endpoint. The service was already using the imported `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant, but needed additional debug logging and error handling improvements.

### Fix Implementation
The fix involved enhancing the `reject-connection.ts` service with:

1. Comprehensive debug logging throughout the service
2. Better error handling for notification failures
3. Improved transaction management
4. Proper client release in the finally block

The service already correctly used the `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant, which includes all necessary checks in a single SQL query:

```sql
WHERE r.id = $1 AND r.related_organization_id = $2 AND r.status = 'pending'
```

This ensures that the endpoint properly validates that:
1. The relationship exists
2. The user is authorized to reject it (belongs to the target organization)
3. The relationship is in 'pending' status

### Testing
The fix has been tested using the `test-connection-reject.js` script, which successfully rejects a pending connection request. The test script has been updated to handle the expected 404 response when a relationship is not found, not in pending status, or the user is not authorized to reject it. Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.

## Connection Termination Endpoint Fix

The `DELETE /api/connections/{relationshipId}` endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows an admin (admin_referring, admin_radiology) to terminate an active connection between organizations.

### Issue Description
The endpoint was previously returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to similar issues as the approval and rejection endpoints. The service needed additional debug logging, better error handling for notification failures, and improved transaction management.

### Fix Implementation
The fix involved enhancing the `terminate-connection.ts` service with:

1. Comprehensive debug logging throughout the service
2. Better error handling for notification failures
3. Improved transaction management
4. Proper client release in the finally block
5. Enhanced error handling in the rollback process

The service uses the `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_TERMINATION_QUERY` constant, which includes all necessary checks in a single SQL query:

```sql
WHERE r.id = $1 AND (r.organization_id = $2 OR r.related_organization_id = $2) AND r.status = 'active'
```

This ensures that the endpoint properly validates that:
1. The relationship exists
2. The user is authorized to terminate it (belongs to either organization in the relationship)
3. The relationship is in 'active' status

### Testing
The fix has been tested using the `test-connection-terminate.js` script, which successfully terminates an active connection. The test script has been created to handle the expected 404 response when a relationship is not found, not in active status, or the user is not authorized to terminate it. Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.

-
-## Core Functionality
-
-### Validation Engine
-
-The RadOrderPad validation engine is the heart of the system, processing clinical indications from physician dictation to assign appropriate CPT and ICD-10 codes. This functionality is critical for ensuring accurate medical coding and compliance with clinical guidelines.
-
-Key aspects of the validation engine include:
-
-1. **LLM Orchestration**
-   - Primary: Claude 3.7
-   - Fallbacks: Grok 3 → GPT-4.0
-   - Uses specialized prompts for different validation scenarios
-
-2. **Validation Workflow**
-   - Initial dictation → Validation processing → Clarification loop (if needed) → Override flow (after 3 failed attempts) → Finalization
-   - Each step is clearly documented with API endpoints and request/response formats
-
-3. **Best Practices for Clinical Dictation**
-   - Patient demographics (age, gender)
-   - Clinical symptoms (location, duration, severity)
-   - Relevant history (prior diagnoses, treatments)
-   - Clinical reasoning (suspected diagnosis, reason for study)
-
-For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the validation documentation linked in the overview section.
-
-### Admin Finalization Workflow
-
-The Admin Finalization workflow is a critical part of the system that allows administrative staff to add EMR context and send orders to radiology after they've been signed by physicians.
-
-Key aspects of the admin finalization workflow include:
-
-1. **Dual Database Architecture**
-   - PHI Database: Contains Protected Health Information (patient data, orders, clinical indications)
-   - Main Database: Contains non-PHI data (organizations, users, credit balances)
-   - Proper transaction management across both databases
-
-2. **Admin Workflow Steps**
-   - Access the Queue: Admin staff access the queue of pending admin orders
-   - Add Patient Information: Update patient demographics (address, city, state, zip code, etc.)
-   - Add Insurance Information: Update insurance details if applicable
-   - Add Supplemental Documentation: Paste any supplemental documentation from EMR
-   - Final Review: Review all information for accuracy
-   - Send to Radiology: Finalize the order and send it to the radiology group
-
-3. **Credit Management**
-   - Checks organization credit balance before sending to radiology
-   - Decrements credits upon successful submission
-   - Handles insufficient credit scenarios
-
-For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the admin finalization documentation linked in the overview section.
-
-## API Conventions
-
-### Base URL
-
-All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:
-```
-https://api.radorderpad.com
-```
-
-### Authentication
-
-Most endpoints require authentication using a JWT token. Include the token in the Authorization header:
-
-```
-Authorization: Bearer <token>
-```
-
-See the [Authentication](./authentication.md) section for details on obtaining a token.
-
-### Request Format
-
-- All request bodies should be in JSON format
-- Include the `Content-Type: application/json` header with all requests that include a body
-
-### Response Format
-
-All responses are in JSON format and typically follow this structure:
-
-```json
-{
-  "success": true,
-  "data": {
-    // Response data specific to the endpoint
-  }
-}
-```
-
-Or in case of an error:
-
-```json
-{
-  "success": false,
-  "message": "Error message describing what went wrong",
-  "error": {
-    // Additional error details (optional)
-  }
-}
-```
-
-### Error Handling
-
-The API uses standard HTTP status codes:
-
-- 200 OK - Request succeeded
-- 400 Bad Request - Invalid request parameters
-- 401 Unauthorized - Missing or invalid authentication
-- 403 Forbidden - Authenticated but not authorized for the requested resource
-- 404 Not Found - Resource not found
-- 500 Internal Server Error - Server-side error
-
-### Pagination
-
-Endpoints that return lists of items typically support pagination with these query parameters:
-
-- `page` - Page number (default: 1)
-- `limit` - Number of items per page (default: 20)
-- `sortBy` - Field to sort by (default varies by endpoint)
-- `sortOrder` - Sort direction ("asc" or "desc", default: "desc")
-
-Paginated responses include a pagination object:
-
-```json
-{
-  "items": [...],
-  "pagination": {
-    "total": 100,
-    "page": 1,
-    "limit": 20,
-    "pages": 5
-  }
-}
-```
-
-## Role-Based Access Control
-
-The API implements role-based access control (RBAC) with these roles:
-
-- `admin_staff` - Administrative staff at referring organizations
-- `physician` - Physicians at referring organizations
-- `admin_referring` - Administrators at referring organizations
-- `super_admin` - System administrators
-- `admin_radiology` - Administrators at radiology organizations
-- `scheduler` - Schedulers at radiology organizations
-- `radiologist` - Radiologists at radiology organizations
-
-Each endpoint specifies which roles are authorized to access it.
-
-## Implementation Notes
-
-This documentation is based on comprehensive testing of the API. Some endpoints may be marked as:
-
-- **Working** - Fully implemented and tested
-- **Partially Working** - Implemented but with limitations or issues
-- **Not Implemented** - Endpoint exists in documentation but returns 404 or 501
-- **Restricted** - Endpoint exists but has method or role restrictions
-
-See the [Status Summary](./status-summary.md) for a complete list of endpoint statuses.
-
-### SQL Implementation Patterns
-
-During our testing and analysis, we identified important SQL implementation patterns that frontend developers should be aware of:
-
-#### LEFT JOIN vs JOIN for Nullable Relationships
-
-When working with the `GET /api/connections/requests` endpoint, we discovered a critical SQL pattern:
-
-- **Issue**: Using standard `JOIN` operations can cause queries to fail when joined records have null values
-- **Solution**: Using `LEFT JOIN` instead preserves the main record even when joined tables have no matching records
-- **Example**: The connection requests endpoint joins the organization_relationships table with organizations and users tables
-- **Impact**: This pattern is essential when querying data that involves optional relationships
-
-This pattern is documented in detail in the [Connection Management Details](./connection-management-details.md) document.
-
-## Testing Tools
-
-### Token Generator
-
-A comprehensive token generator script is provided to simplify API testing across different user roles. This script generates authentication tokens for all roles in the system and saves them to separate files.
-
-#### Usage
-
-1. Run the token generator script:
-   ```
-   node generate-all-role-tokens.js
-   ```
-
-2. The script will:
-   - Generate tokens for all 7 roles (admin_staff, physician, admin_referring, super_admin, admin_radiology, scheduler, radiologist)
-   - Save each token to a separate file in the `tokens` directory
-   - Create convenience scripts for setting environment variables
-
-3. Use the generated tokens for testing endpoints with different role permissions:
-   ```javascript
-   // Example: Using the admin_referring token
-   const token = fs.readFileSync('tokens/admin_referring-token.txt', 'utf8');
-   
-   // Make API request with the token
-   const response = await axios.post('https://api.radorderpad.com/api/user-invites/invite',
-     { email: 'test.user@example.com', role: 'physician' },
-     { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` } }
-   );
-   ```
-
-4. Alternatively, use the convenience scripts to set environment variables:
-   - Windows: `set-token-env-vars.bat`
-   - PowerShell: `Set-TokenEnvVars.ps1`
-
-### Testing User Invitation Endpoints
-
-The user invitation system has been thoroughly tested and fixed to ensure proper functionality. Here's how the endpoints were tested:
-
-1. **User Invite Endpoint (`POST /api/user-invites/invite`)**:
-   - Tested with admin_referring token (required role)
-   - Verified successful invitation creation (201 Created)
-   - Tested error cases: invalid email format, missing fields, insufficient permissions
-
-2. **Accept Invitation Endpoint (`POST /api/user-invites/accept-invitation`)**:
-   - Tested with various token scenarios
-   - Verified proper validation of invitation tokens
-   - Tested error cases: invalid token, missing required fields, weak password
-
-3. **Routing Configuration Fix**:
-   - Fixed middleware conflict by changing the mounting path for user-invite routes from '/users' to '/user-invites'
-   - This resolved authentication issues where the wrong middleware was being applied
-
-For detailed implementation information, see the [User Invitation Details](./user-invitation-details.md) document.

-
-## Recent Fixes
-
-### Admin Finalization "Send to Radiology" Fix
-
-The `POST /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/send-to-radiology-fixed` endpoint has been implemented to fix issues with the original send-to-radiology endpoint. This endpoint is critical for the admin finalization workflow, allowing administrative staff to send validated and signed orders to radiology organizations.
-
-#### Issue Description
-The original endpoint was failing with a 500 error due to database connection issues. The root cause was:
-- The endpoint needed to interact with both PHI and Main databases
-- It was using a single database connection (PHI) to try to access tables in both databases
-- It was using incorrect column names for the order_history table
-
-#### Fix Implementation
-The fix includes:
-- Proper dual database connections for PHI and Main databases
-- Transaction management across both databases
-- Correct column names for the order_history table
-- Credit balance validation and consumption
-- Comprehensive error handling
-
-For detailed implementation information, see the [Admin Finalization API Guide](./admin-finalization-api-guide.md) document.
-
-### Connection Approval Endpoint Fix
-
-The `POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve` endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows an admin (admin_referring, admin_radiology) of the target organization to approve a connection request initiated by another organization.
-
-#### Issue Description
-The endpoint was previously returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to an improper SQL query implementation. The service was using a custom query to check if the relationship exists, but it wasn't using the imported `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant.
-
-The custom query only checked if the relationship exists by ID, but it didn't check if the related_organization_id matches the approvingOrgId or if the status is 'pending' in the SQL query itself. Instead, it did these checks after fetching the relationship, which could lead to issues if the relationship doesn't exist or if it's not in the expected state.
-
-#### Fix Implementation
-The fix was to update the `approve-connection.ts` service to use the imported `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant, which includes all necessary checks in a single SQL query:
-
-```sql
-WHERE r.id = $1 AND r.related_organization_id = $2 AND r.status = 'pending'
-```
-
-This ensures that the endpoint properly validates that:
-1. The relationship exists
-2. The user is authorized to approve it (belongs to the target organization)
-3. The relationship is in 'pending' status
-
-All of these checks are now done in a single SQL query, which is more efficient and less error-prone.
-
-#### Testing
-The fix has been tested using the `test-connection-approve.js` script, which successfully approves a pending connection request. The test script has been updated to run from the correct directory, and both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.
-
-### Connection Rejection Endpoint Fix
-
-The `POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/reject` endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows an admin (admin_referring, admin_radiology) of the target organization to reject a connection request initiated by another organization.
-
-#### Issue Description
-The endpoint was previously returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to similar issues as the approval endpoint. The service was already using the imported `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant, but needed additional debug logging and error handling improvements.
-
-#### Fix Implementation
-The fix involved enhancing the `reject-connection.ts` service with:
-
-1. Comprehensive debug logging throughout the service
-2. Better error handling for notification failures
-3. Improved transaction management
-4. Proper client release in the finally block
-
-The service already correctly used the `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_APPROVAL_QUERY` constant, which includes all necessary checks in a single SQL query:
-
-```sql
-WHERE r.id = $1 AND r.related_organization_id = $2 AND r.status = 'pending'
-```
-
-This ensures that the endpoint properly validates that:
-1. The relationship exists
-2. The user is authorized to reject it (belongs to the target organization)
-3. The relationship is in 'pending' status
-
-#### Testing
-The fix has been tested using the `test-connection-reject.js` script, which successfully rejects a pending connection request. The test script has been updated to handle the expected 404 response when a relationship is not found, not in pending status, or the user is not authorized to reject it. Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.
-
-### Connection Termination Endpoint Fix
-
-The `DELETE /api/connections/{relationshipId}` endpoint has been fixed and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows an admin (admin_referring, admin_radiology) to terminate an active connection between organizations.
-
-#### Issue Description
-The endpoint was previously returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to similar issues as the approval and rejection endpoints. The service needed additional debug logging, better error handling for notification failures, and improved transaction management.
-
-#### Fix Implementation
-The fix involved enhancing the `terminate-connection.ts` service with:
-
-1. Comprehensive debug logging throughout the service
-2. Better error handling for notification failures
-3. Improved transaction management
-4. Proper client release in the finally block
-5. Enhanced error handling in the rollback process
-
-The service uses the `GET_RELATIONSHIP_FOR_TERMINATION_QUERY` constant, which includes all necessary checks in a single SQL query:
-
-```sql
-WHERE r.id = $1 AND (r.organization_id = $2 OR r.related_organization_id = $2) AND r.status = 'active'
-```
-
-This ensures that the endpoint properly validates that:
-1. The relationship exists
-2. The user is authorized to terminate it (belongs to either organization in the relationship)
-3. The relationship is in 'active' status
-
-#### Testing
-The fix has been tested using the `test-connection-terminate.js` script, which successfully terminates an active connection. The test script has been created to handle the expected 404 response when a relationship is not found, not in active status, or the user is not authorized to terminate it. Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.
-
-### User Profile Update Endpoint Implementation
-
-The `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint has been implemented and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows authenticated users to update their own profile information.
-
-#### Implementation Details
-
-The implementation follows the modular, single-responsibility approach with proper validation and error handling:
-
-1. A new service function `updateUserProfile` was created in `src/services/user/update-user-profile.service.ts` that:
-   - Handles updating user profile data
-   - Validates input fields
-   - Uses queryMainDb for database operations
-   - Returns the updated user profile
-
-2. The user controller was updated with an `updateMe` method that:
-   - Extracts allowed updatable fields from request body (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, specialty, npi)
-   - Implements validation for request body fields
-   - Adds proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
-   - Returns a 200 OK response with the updated user profile on success
-
-3. The user routes were updated to add the PUT /me route with:
-   - authenticateJWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint
-   - JSDoc comments for API documentation
-
-#### Security Considerations
-
-The endpoint is designed with security in mind:
-- Only allows users to update their own profile
-- Restricts which fields can be updated (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, specialty, npi)
-- Explicitly prevents updating sensitive fields like role, organization_id, is_active, email_verified, and email
-
-#### Testing
-
-The implementation has been tested using the `test-update-user-me.js` script, which:
-- Tests successful profile updates
-- Tests validation of input fields
-- Tests handling of restricted fields
-- Tests authentication requirements
-
-Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.
-
-### User Update by ID Endpoint Implementation
-
-The `PUT /api/users/{userId}` endpoint has been implemented and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows organization administrators to update profile information for users within their organization.
-
-#### Implementation Details
-
-The implementation follows the modular, single-responsibility approach with proper validation, error handling, and organization boundary enforcement:
-
-1. A new service function `updateUserInOrg` was created in `src/services/user/update-user-in-org.service.ts` that:
-   - Handles updating user profile data for users within the admin's organization
-   - Enforces organization boundaries through SQL query constraints
-   - Validates input fields
-   - Uses queryMainDb for database operations
-   - Returns the updated user profile or null if the user is not found or not in the admin's organization
-
-2. The user controller was updated with an `updateOrgUserById` method that:
-   - Extracts and validates the userId from request parameters
-   - Extracts allowed updatable fields from request body (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, specialty, npi, role, isActive)
-   - Implements validation for request body fields and role assignment restrictions
-   - Adds proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
-   - Returns a 200 OK response with the updated user profile on success
-
-3. The user routes were updated to add the PUT /:userId route with:
-   - authenticateJWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint
-   - authorizeRole middleware to restrict access to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles
-   - JSDoc comments for API documentation
-
-#### Security Considerations
-
-The endpoint is designed with security in mind:
-- Enforces organization boundaries - admins can only update users within their own organization
-- Implements role-based restrictions for role assignment:
-  - admin_referring can only assign physician and admin_staff roles
-  - admin_radiology can only assign scheduler and radiologist roles
-- Prevents privilege escalation through role assignment restrictions
-- Restricts which fields can be updated (firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, specialty, npi, role, isActive)
-- Explicitly prevents updating sensitive fields like organization_id, email_verified, and email
-
-#### Testing
-
-The implementation has been tested using the `test-update-org-user.js` script, which:
-- Tests successful user updates within the admin's organization
-- Tests organization boundary enforcement (cannot update users in other organizations)
-- Tests role assignment restrictions
-- Tests validation of input fields
-- Tests authentication and authorization requirements
-
-Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.

-### User Deactivation Endpoint Implementation
-
-The `DELETE /api/users/{userId}` endpoint has been implemented and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows organization administrators to deactivate users within their organization by setting their is_active flag to false.
-
-#### Implementation Details
-
-The implementation follows the modular, single-responsibility approach with proper validation, error handling, and organization boundary enforcement:
-
-1. A new service function `deactivateUserInOrg` was created in `src/services/user/deactivate-user-in-org.service.ts` that:
-   - Handles deactivating a user by setting is_active to false
-   - Enforces organization boundaries through SQL query constraints
-   - Uses queryMainDb for database operations
-   - Returns a boolean indicating success or failure
-
-2. The user controller was updated with a `deactivateOrgUserById` method that:
-   - Extracts and validates the userId from request parameters
-   - Prevents administrators from deactivating their own accounts
-   - Adds proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
-   - Returns a 200 OK response with a success message on successful deactivation
-
-### File Upload Endpoints Implementation
-
-The file upload endpoints have been implemented and are now working correctly. These endpoints enable secure file uploads to AWS S3 using the presigned URL pattern.
-
-#### Implementation Details
-
-1. **POST /api/uploads/presigned-url**
-   - Generates a presigned URL for direct S3 upload
-   - Validates file type, size, and other parameters
-   - Returns a presigned URL and file key to the client
-   - Supports various document types (signature, insurance_card, lab_report, etc.)
-   - Implements file size limits (20MB for PDFs, 5MB for other file types)
-
-2. **POST /api/uploads/confirm**
-   - Confirms that a file has been successfully uploaded to S3
-   - Verifies the file exists in S3 before creating a database record
-   - Creates a record in the document_uploads table in the PHI database
-   - Associates the uploaded file with an order and/or patient
-   - Implements proper validation and error handling
-
-#### Security Considerations
-
-The implementation follows the presigned URL pattern for enhanced security:
-- The backend controls access and generates temporary, scoped credentials
-- S3 bucket remains private with no public access
-- Backend AWS credentials are not exposed to the client
-- File uploads go directly to S3, offloading the backend API servers
-- File type validation prevents uploading of potentially malicious files
-
-#### Testing
-
-Both endpoints have been tested using comprehensive test scripts:
-- test-uploads-presigned-url.js/bat/sh for testing the presigned URL endpoint
-- test-uploads-confirm.js/bat/sh for testing the confirm endpoint
-- Tests include various scenarios: valid requests, missing fields, invalid file types, file size limits, authentication requirements
-
-3. The user routes were updated to add the DELETE /:userId route with:
-   - authenticateJWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint
-   - authorizeRole middleware to restrict access to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles
-   - JSDoc comments for API documentation
-
-#### Security Considerations
-
-The endpoint is designed with security in mind:
-- Enforces organization boundaries - admins can only deactivate users within their own organization
-- Prevents self-deactivation to avoid administrators accidentally locking themselves out of the system
-- Implements a "soft delete" approach that preserves user records while preventing system access
-
-#### Testing
-
-The implementation has been tested using the `test-deactivate-org-user.js` script, which:
-- Tests successful user deactivation within the admin's organization
-- Tests organization boundary enforcement (cannot deactivate users in other organizations)
-- Tests self-deactivation prevention
-- Tests validation of input parameters
-- Tests authentication and authorization requirements
-
-Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.

-### Organization Profile Update Endpoint Implementation
-
-The `PUT /api/organizations/mine` endpoint has been implemented and is now working correctly. This endpoint allows organization administrators to update their organization's profile information.
-
-#### Implementation Details
-
-The implementation follows the modular, single-responsibility approach with proper validation and error handling:
-
-1. A new service function `updateOrganizationProfile` was created in `src/services/organization/update-organization-profile.service.ts` that:
-   - Handles updating organization profile data
-   - Validates input fields
-   - Uses queryMainDb for database operations
-   - Returns the updated organization profile
-
-2. The organization controller was updated with an `updateMyOrganizationController` method that:
-   - Extracts allowed updatable fields from request body (name, npi, tax_id, address_line1, address_line2, city, state, zip_code, phone_number, fax_number, contact_email, website, logo_url)
-   - Implements validation for request body fields
-   - Adds proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
-   - Returns a 200 OK response with the updated organization profile on success
-
-3. The organization routes were updated to add the PUT /mine route with:
-   - authenticateJWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint
-   - authorizeRole middleware to restrict access to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles
-   - JSDoc comments for API documentation
-
-#### Security Considerations
-
-The endpoint is designed with security in mind:
-- Only allows administrators to update their own organization's profile
-- Restricts which fields can be updated (name, npi, tax_id, address_line1, address_line2, city, state, zip_code, phone_number, fax_number, contact_email, website, logo_url)
-- Explicitly prevents updating sensitive fields like id, type, status, credit_balance, billing_id, subscription_tier, assigned_account_manager_id
-- Validates email format and website URL format
-
-#### Testing
-
-The implementation has been tested using the `test-update-org-mine.js` script, which:
-- Tests successful organization profile updates
-- Tests validation of input fields
-- Tests handling of restricted fields
-- Tests authentication and authorization requirements
-
-Both batch (.bat) and shell (.sh) scripts have been created to run the test.

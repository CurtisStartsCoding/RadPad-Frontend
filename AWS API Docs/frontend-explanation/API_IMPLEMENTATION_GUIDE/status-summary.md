- `GET /api/uploads/{documentId}/download-url`: Generate a presigned URL for downloading a previously uploaded file (tested with admin_referring role)
- Full end-to-end testing implemented:
  - Test scripts demonstrate the complete flow from getting presigned URL to confirming upload and downloading files
  - Tests handle the case where S3 upload is skipped (due to lack of permissions in test environments)
  - Expected 500 error when the file doesn't exist in S3 confirms the backend is properly checking file existence
  - Authorization checks ensure users can only access files associated with their organization

## Endpoints with Method Restrictions

The following endpoints have specific method restrictions by design:

- `GET /api/auth/login`: Returns 404 "Route not found" error - This is by design as the login endpoint only accepts POST requests
- `POST /api/orders` (direct order creation): Returns 404 "Route not found" error - This is by design, as order creation is handled implicitly by the `/api/orders/validate` endpoint when called without an existing orderId

## Endpoints with Path Restrictions

The following endpoints have specific path restrictions by design:

- `GET /api/superadmin`: Returns 404 "Route not found" error - This is by design as the route is not defined for the base path. Use specific superadmin endpoints like `GET /api/superadmin/users` or `GET /api/superadmin/organizations` instead

## Endpoints with Role Restrictions

The following endpoints work correctly but are restricted to specific roles:

- `GET /api/superadmin/organizations`: Works correctly and returns a list of all organizations (super_admin role only)
- `GET /api/superadmin/users`: Works correctly and returns a list of all users (super_admin role only)
- `GET /api/users`: Works correctly and returns a list of users in the authenticated user's organization (admin_referring and admin_radiology roles only)
- `GET /api/users/{userId}`: Works correctly and returns a specific user's profile, but is restricted to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles and only allows viewing users within the admin's organization
- `GET /api/radiology/orders`: Works correctly but is restricted to scheduler and admin_radiology roles
- `GET /api/connections`: Works correctly but is restricted to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles
- `GET /api/connections/requests`: Works correctly but is restricted to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles
- `POST /api/user-invites/invite`: Works correctly but is restricted to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles

## Non-Working or Not Implemented Endpoints

The following endpoints were tested but are not currently working in the production deployment:

- `GET /api/billing`: Returns 404 "Route not found" error - The dist/routes/billing.routes.js file does not define a handler for the base GET / path. It only defines POST routes for creating checkout sessions and subscriptions.

## Implementation Recommendations for Frontend Developers

Based on the testing results, frontend developers should:

1. **Use the working endpoints** for core functionality:
   - Authentication
   - Order listing and filtering
   - Order validation (with CPT and ICD-10 code suggestions)
   - Order details retrieval
   - Sending orders to radiology
   - User invitation

2. **Be aware of role restrictions** when implementing features:
   - Ensure the user has the appropriate role before attempting to access role-restricted endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling for 403 Forbidden responses

3. **Handle timeouts appropriately** for the validation endpoint:
   - The validation endpoint can take 11-15 seconds to complete
   - Implement a loading state and progress indicator
   - Set request timeouts to at least 30 seconds

4. **Use implicit order creation** through the validation endpoint:
   - There is no separate endpoint for order creation
   - New orders are created by calling the validation endpoint without an orderId

5. **Implement proper error handling** for non-working endpoints:
   - Some endpoints may return 404 or 501 errors
   - Implement fallback behavior or disable features that rely on non-working endpoints

6. **Implement user invitation and acceptance functionality**:
   - Use the `POST /api/user-invites/invite` endpoint to invite new users
   - Ensure proper validation of email format and role
   - Handle 409 Conflict responses for duplicate invitations
   - Restrict invitation access to admin_referring and admin_radiology roles only
   - Implement a form for invited users to accept invitations using the `POST /api/user-invites/accept-invitation` endpoint
   - Validate password strength and required fields
   - Store the JWT token returned upon successful acceptance for authentication
   
   7. **Implement file upload and download functionality** using the presigned URL pattern:
      - Use the `POST /api/uploads/presigned-url` endpoint to get a presigned URL for S3 upload
      - Upload the file directly to S3 using the presigned URL (PUT request with appropriate Content-Type header)
      - Confirm the upload using the `POST /api/uploads/confirm` endpoint
      - Use the `GET /api/uploads/{documentId}/download-url` endpoint to get a presigned URL for downloading files
      - Handle file type validation and size limits (20MB for PDFs, 5MB for other file types)
      - Implement proper error handling for S3 upload failures
      - Be aware that the confirm endpoint checks if the file exists in S3 before creating a database record
      - In production environments with proper S3 permissions, the confirm endpoint will succeed if the file was uploaded successfully
      - Ensure proper authorization checks when downloading files (users can only access files associated with their organization)
   
   8. **Implement user location assignment functionality**:
      - Use the `GET /api/user-locations/{userId}/locations` endpoint to retrieve locations assigned to a user
      - Use the `POST /api/user-locations/{userId}/locations/{locationId}` endpoint to assign a user to a location
      - Use the `DELETE /api/user-locations/{userId}/locations/{locationId}` endpoint to unassign a user from a location
      - Implement a user location management interface for administrators
      - Ensure proper error handling for 404 responses (user or location not found, or not in admin's organization)
      - Use this functionality to restrict users to specific locations within their organization
   
   9. **Consider implementing the missing GET /api/billing endpoint** if billing information is needed:
      - This would require backend changes to add the endpoint
      - In the meantime, consider using alternative approaches to display billing information

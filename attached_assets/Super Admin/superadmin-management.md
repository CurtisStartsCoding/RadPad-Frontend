## Path Restrictions

The following superadmin-related endpoints have path restrictions:

- `GET /api/superadmin`: Returns 404 "Route not found" error - This is by design as the route is not defined for the base path. Use specific superadmin endpoints like `GET /api/superadmin/users` or `GET /api/superadmin/organizations` instead.

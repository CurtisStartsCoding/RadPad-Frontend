# Testing Strategy for Missing API Endpoints

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for testing and documenting the missing API endpoints identified in our API documentation review. The goal is to ensure that all endpoints are properly tested and documented, with a particular focus on the validation endpoint that is critical for assigning CPT and ICD-10 codes based on clinical indications.

## Current Status

We have identified several API endpoints that are not fully documented in our API documentation. These endpoints are part of important workflows but are missing from our current documentation. The missing endpoints are listed in the `missing-endpoints-report.md` file in the `frontend-explanation/API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE` directory.

## Testing Approach

We have created a comprehensive test script (`test-all-missing-endpoints.js`) that tests all the missing endpoints in sequence. The script is designed to:

1. Make HTTP requests to each endpoint with appropriate authentication and request data
2. Log the results of each request, including status codes and response data
3. Provide clear indications of which endpoints are working and which are not
4. Document the response structure for successful requests

## Testing Process

To test the missing endpoints:

1. The script uses a hardcoded JWT_SECRET for testing purposes
   - This secret is used to generate tokens for different user roles
   - In a production scenario, you would use your actual JWT secret

2. (Optional) Update the placeholder IDs in the test script with valid values
   - For more accurate testing, replace the placeholder IDs with real entity IDs
   - For example, VALID_ORDER_ID_PENDING_ADMIN should be an order that is actually in the "pending_admin" state
   - The script will run with the default values, but may return 404 errors for non-existent entities

3. Run the test script using the provided batch file
   - The script will make requests to each endpoint
   - It will log the results of each request without requiring any user interaction

4. Review the results of each test
   - ✅ PASSED with status 200/201: Endpoint exists and responded successfully
   - ❌ FAILED: Check the Status and Error Data for details
   - ⚠️ SKIPPING: Tests that require manual setup or might have side effects

5. Use the results to update the API documentation
   - Document the request format
   - Document the response structure
   - Document error cases
   - Document any special requirements or restrictions

## Documentation Process

After running the tests, use the results to update the API documentation in the `frontend-explanation/API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE` directory. For each endpoint:

1. Copy the documentation template from `documentation-template.md`
2. Fill in the details based on the test results
3. Add the documentation to the appropriate file in the API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE directory

## Files

- **test-all-missing-endpoints.js**: The main test script
- **run-missing-endpoints-test.bat**: Batch file to run the test script
- **README.md**: Instructions for using the test scripts
- **documentation-template.md**: Template for documenting endpoints
- **TESTING_STRATEGY.md**: This file

## Focus on Validation Endpoint

The validation endpoint (`/api/orders/validate`) is already extensively documented in the `order-management.md` file, as it's the most critical endpoint for assigning CPT and ICD-10 codes based on clinical indications. This endpoint:

1. Takes dictation text and patient information as input
2. Processes the dictation to determine appropriate CPT and ICD-10 codes
3. Returns validation status, compliance score, feedback, and suggested codes with confidence scores

The validation endpoint is a key part of the order creation workflow and is critical for ensuring accurate code assignment.

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify all missing endpoints
2. Document the results of each test
3. Update the API documentation with the new information
4. Review the updated documentation for completeness and accuracy
5. Share the updated documentation with frontend developers

By following this testing strategy, we can ensure that all API endpoints are properly documented, making it easier for frontend developers to integrate with the API and for the system to accurately assign CPT and ICD-10 codes based on clinical indications.

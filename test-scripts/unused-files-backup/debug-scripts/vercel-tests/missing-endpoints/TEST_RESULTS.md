# Missing Endpoints Test Results

This document summarizes the results of testing the missing API endpoints identified in our API documentation review.

## Test Environment

- **API URL**: https://api.radorderpad.com
- **Test Date**: April 22, 2025
- **Test Method**: Automated script with real user credentials from test-login-all-roles.js

## Test Results Summary

We successfully authenticated with all user roles, but most endpoints still returned errors. The errors were more specific this time, providing valuable information about the endpoints' requirements and implementation status.

### Authentication Success

All authentication attempts were successful:
- admin_staff
- physician
- admin_referring
- super_admin
- admin_radiology
- scheduler
- radiologist

### Endpoint Results

1. **Working Endpoints**:
   - POST /api/organizations/mine/locations - Successfully created a location

2. **Endpoints with Validation Errors**:
   - POST /api/uploads/presigned-url - Missing required fields
   - Admin order endpoints - Order not in correct status

3. **Endpoints with Server Errors**:
   - GET /api/admin/orders/queue - Internal server error
   - Connection management endpoints - Internal server errors

## Detailed Results by Endpoint

### Organization Location Management

  - Conclusion: Endpoint might exist but has implementation issues

- **POST /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/paste-summary**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Order 607 is not in pending_admin status"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint exists but requires an order in the correct status

- **POST /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/paste-supplemental**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Order 607 is not in pending_admin status"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint exists but requires an order in the correct status

- **PUT /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/patient-info**

  - Conclusion: Endpoint exists but requires an order in the correct status

- **PUT /api/admin/orders/{orderId}/insurance-info**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Order 607 is not in pending_admin status"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint exists but requires an order in the correct status

### Connection Management

- **GET /api/connections/requests**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Internal server error"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint might exist but has implementation issues

- **POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/approve**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Internal server error"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint might exist but has implementation issues

- **POST /api/connections/{relationshipId}/reject**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Internal server error"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint might exist but has implementation issues

- **DELETE /api/connections/{relationshipId}**
  - Status: 500
  - Error: "Internal server error"
  - Conclusion: Endpoint might exist but has implementation issues

## Documentation Insights

Based on these test results, we can document the following:

1. **Organization Location Management**:
   - POST /api/organizations/mine/locations is fully functional
   - Required fields: name, address_line1, city, state, zip_code
   - Returns a 201 status with the created location object

2. **Uploads**:
   - POST /api/uploads/presigned-url requires fileType, fileName, and contentType fields
   - POST /api/uploads/confirm requires a valid fileKey from a previous presigned URL request

3. **Admin Order Management**:
   - All admin order endpoints require an order in the "pending_admin" status
   - The order ID must be valid and in the correct status

4. **Connection Management**:
   - Connection endpoints exist but may have implementation issues
   - More testing is needed with valid relationship IDs

## Next Steps

To get more accurate test results, we need to:

1. Fix the uploads/presigned-url request to include all required fields
2. Find an order that is actually in "pending_admin" status
3. Investigate the connection management endpoints further

These results provide valuable information for updating the API documentation, especially regarding the required fields and status requirements for each endpoint.

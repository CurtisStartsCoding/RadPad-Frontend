# Additional Test Results

We've conducted more comprehensive testing with multiple order IDs and relationship IDs to further investigate the API endpoints.

## Test Environment

- **API URL**: https://api.radorderpad.com
- **Test Date**: April 22, 2025
- **Test Method**: Enhanced script testing multiple IDs for each endpoint

## Admin Order Endpoints

We tested order IDs from 607 to 620 and found:

- **Order Existence**:
  - Some orders don't exist (404 errors for IDs 608, 619, 620)
  - Most orders exist but are not in pending_admin status

- **Error Types**:
  - Most orders return: "Order X is not in pending_admin status"
  - Some orders have a database schema issue (500 errors about "column authorization_number does not exist" for IDs 609, 612)

This confirms that:
1. The endpoints exist and are processing requests
2. They correctly validate that orders must be in pending_admin status
3. There may be a database schema issue with some orders

## Connection Management Endpoints

We tested relationship IDs from 1 to 10 for all connection endpoints:

- **Approve Endpoint**: All IDs returned 500 internal server errors
- **Reject Endpoint**: All IDs returned 500 internal server errors
- **Delete Endpoint**: All IDs returned 500 internal server errors

This suggests there might be deeper implementation issues with these endpoints rather than just invalid relationship IDs.

## Updated Next Steps

Based on these additional findings, we recommend:

1. **Fix the uploads/presigned-url endpoint**
   - Configure AWS credentials and S3 bucket name on the server

2. **Create an order specifically in pending_admin status**
   - Our tests show that no existing orders are in this status
   - We need to create a new order and move it to pending_admin status

3. **Debug the connection management endpoints**
   - Investigate the internal server errors at a deeper level
   - Check the server logs for more detailed error messages

4. **Address the database schema issue**
   - Some orders are failing with "column authorization_number does not exist"
   - This suggests a database migration or schema update might be needed

5. **Update the documentation with specific requirements**
   - Document the exact status requirements for each endpoint
   - Include error cases and validation requirements

## Conclusion

Our enhanced testing has provided more specific insights into the API endpoints. While most endpoints exist, they have specific requirements or implementation issues that need to be addressed before they can be fully documented and used.

# Admin Endpoints Test Results

We've tested the admin order endpoints with a range of order IDs (600-619) to find which ones work with which endpoints.

## Test Environment

- **API URL**: https://api.radorderpad.com
- **Test Date**: April 22, 2025
- **Test Method**: Direct testing with multiple order IDs

## Summary of Results

### Working Endpoints by Order ID

| Order ID | paste-summary | paste-supplemental | patient-info | insurance-info |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 600      | ❌            | ✅                | ✅           | ✅             |
| 601      | ❌            | ✅                | ✅           | ✅             |
| 603      | ❌            | ✅                | ✅           | ✅             |
| 604      | ❌            | ✅                | ✅           | ✅             |
| 609      | ❌            | ✅                | ✅           | ✅             |
| 612      | ❌            | ✅                | ✅           | ✅             |

### Error Types by Endpoint

#### paste-summary
- All order IDs failed with either:
  - "column authorization_number does not exist" (500 error)
  - "Order X is not in pending_admin status" (500 error)
  - "Order X not found" (404 error)

#### paste-supplemental, patient-info, insurance-info
- Working with order IDs: 600, 601, 603, 604, 609, 612
- Other order IDs failed with either:
  - "Order X is not in pending_admin status" (500 error)
  - "Order X not found" (404 error)

## Detailed Analysis

1. **Database Schema Issue**
   - The paste-summary endpoint consistently fails with "column authorization_number does not exist" for several order IDs
   - This suggests a database schema mismatch or missing migration

2. **Status Validation**
   - All endpoints correctly validate that orders must be in pending_admin status
   - However, the paste-supplemental, patient-info, and insurance-info endpoints seem to bypass this check for certain order IDs

3. **Endpoint Implementation**
   - The paste-summary endpoint appears to have a specific implementation issue
   - The other endpoints work correctly with certain order IDs

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix the paste-summary endpoint**
   - Investigate the "column authorization_number does not exist" error
   - Check if a database migration is needed

2. **Update the test script**
   - Use order IDs 600, 601, 603, 604, 609, or 612 for testing the working endpoints
   - Document that paste-summary has implementation issues

3. **Update API documentation**
   - Document that paste-supplemental, patient-info, and insurance-info endpoints work with specific order IDs
   - Note that paste-summary has implementation issues

## Conclusion

This testing has revealed that three of the four admin order endpoints are functional with specific order IDs, while the paste-summary endpoint has implementation issues. This information can be used to update the API documentation and guide further development efforts.

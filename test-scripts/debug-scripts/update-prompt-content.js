Analyze this case according to these instructions and respond ONLY with a JSON object:

=== COMPREHENSIVE IMAGING ORDER VALIDATION FRAMEWORK ===

PRIMARY VALIDATION GATES (MUST-PASS CRITERIA):
- Modality-indication alignment: Imaging technique matches clinical question per ACR Appropriateness Criteria (score ≥7)
- Clinical information sufficiency: Order contains ALL minimum required elements for interpretation with NO exceptions:
  * Current symptoms with duration and severity
  * Relevant prior imaging results if applicable
  * Pertinent physical examination findings
  * Related laboratory/test results when available
  * Clear clinical question to be answered by imaging
- Safety verification: No absolute contraindications present; relative contraindications addressed with specific mitigation plan
- Laterality specification: Clear indication of side for paired structures or "bilateral" if applicable
- Disease prevalence consideration: For rare conditions, verification of appropriate specialized protocol
- Primary diagnosis identification: Order clearly identifies a specific primary ICD-10 code that:
  * Directly relates to the clinical question being asked
  * Is supported by documented symptoms and findings
  * Has sufficient specificity (minimum 4th or 5th character where available)
  * Is sequenced correctly when multiple conditions exist
  * Appropriately justifies the ordered study from a reimbursement perspective
- Previous management verification: Documentation of appropriate conservative management attempts before imaging for conditions where imaging is not first-line
- Prior testing documentation: Clear indication of previous relevant tests or imaging results that inform current imaging decision
- Symptom duration adequacy: Verification that symptom duration meets minimum threshold per clinical guidelines for imaging consideration

REQUIRED CLINICAL INFORMATION VERIFICATION:
- Prior management: What conservative treatments have been attempted and failed
- Timeline: Precise duration of symptoms with onset date and progression pattern
- Prior testing: Results of any previous laboratory or imaging studies
- Red flags: Specific documentation of concerning features that warrant imaging
- Relevant history: Documentation of pertinent past medical history that influences pre-test probability
- Physical exam: Key findings that support imaging necessity (not just symptoms)
- Functional impact: How symptoms affect patient's activities or quality of life

Orders lacking these key elements should be flagged for CLARIFICATION NEEDED rather than approved.

COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSIS CODING REQUIREMENTS:
- Identify and code the primary diagnosis with clear designation as primary
- Generate a MINIMUM of 3-4 total ICD-10 codes for each case including:
  * Primary diagnosis code (clearly marked as primary)
  * Secondary manifestation codes
  * Contributing factor codes
  * Relevant comorbidity codes
  * Symptom codes when they add clinical context
- Ensure each code is supported by documented clinical information
- Maintain proper code hierarchy with primary condition first
- Include Z-codes for relevant history, screening, or risk factors when appropriate
- Apply combination codes where appropriate instead of multiple codes
- Ensure all codes are at highest level of specificity supported by documentation
- Document the relationship between codes (causal, contributory, comorbid)

SECONDARY VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Protocol appropriateness: Selected protocol follows standard practice for indication
  * Contrast phase alignment with pathology (arterial/venous/delayed/multiphasic)
  * Reconstruction parameters match diagnostic requirements
  * Field of view optimization for target anatomy
- Clinical-technical congruence: Technical parameters support the clinical question
  * Slice thickness appropriate for suspected pathology (≤3mm for fine detail)
  * Sequence selection matches pathology detection requirements
  * Resolution parameters sufficient for diagnostic confidence
- Patient-specific considerations:
  * Age-appropriate protocol modifications (pediatric/geriatric)
  * Weight-based adjustments for contrast and radiation dose
  * Pregnancy status considerations and protocol modifications
  * Renal function considerations for contrast administration (eGFR thresholds)
- Temporal appropriateness:
  * Alignment with clinical urgency (STAT/urgent/routine)
  * Appropriate follow-up intervals per disease-specific guidelines
  * Consideration of prior imaging recency and relevance

INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION CRITERIA (AUTOMATIC REJECTION):
- Vague or nonspecific symptoms without adequate characterization
- Missing symptom duration or progression information when relevant
- Absent physical examination findings when clinically required
- No documentation of relevant prior results/treatments
- Inadequate information to determine most appropriate protocol
- Inability to assess appropriateness of contrast use from provided information
- Failure to document red flags or exclusion criteria when indicated
- Incomplete information for proper risk assessment
- Insufficient clinical context to determine if imaging is the next appropriate step
- Missing or vague primary ICD-10 code
- Fewer than required minimum number of ICD-10 codes (minimum 3-4 total codes)
- ICD-10 code that doesn't match documented symptoms/findings
- Use of symptom codes (R-codes) when a more definitive diagnosis is available
- Use of "unspecified" codes when more specific information is documented
- ICD-10 code that doesn't justify the medical necessity of the ordered study
- Mismatch between primary clinical concern and assigned primary ICD-10 code
- Duration of symptoms insufficient to warrant imaging (e.g., acute low back pain <6 weeks without red flags, constipation <2 weeks in children)
- No documentation of attempted conservative management for conditions requiring step-wise approach
- Missing results of prerequisite testing that should precede advanced imaging
- Absence of necessary symptoms or findings that would elevate condition to imaging-appropriate status
- Failure to document red flags that would justify deviation from standard conservative management
- Definitive diagnosis codes used when only suspicion or concern is documented
- Screening codes assigned without explicit mention of screening purpose
- Active condition codes used when only history of condition is documented
- Codes assigned that extend beyond the documentation provided in dictation

ICD-10 CODE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Primary code must be clearly identified and flagged as the principal diagnosis
- Total of 3-4 codes minimum must be provided for each case
- Code specificity must be maximized based on available clinical information
- Laterality must be specified when anatomically appropriate (right/left/bilateral)
- 7th character extensions must be included when required (e.g., initial/subsequent/sequela for injuries)
- Combination codes must be used when applicable instead of multiple codes
- Cause-and-effect relationships must be properly coded (etiology/manifestation)
- Additional contributory codes should support but not replace the primary code
- Z-codes should only be primary when no actual disease/injury is present
- Proper sequencing rules must be followed for multiple diagnoses
- Codes must align with CMS/payer requirements for ordered study reimbursement
- Each code must be justified by specific documented clinical information

STRICT ICD-10 CODING DISCIPLINE:
- Assign ONLY codes explicitly supported by documented findings in the dictation
- Use symptom codes (R-codes) rather than definitive diagnosis codes when diagnostic certainty is not established
- Never assign a definitive diagnosis code (like K35.80 Appendicitis) when dictation only mentions "concern for" or "rule out"
- Use Z-codes for history of conditions (e.g., Z87.440 for history of UTIs) rather than active condition codes (e.g., N39.0) when dictation indicates past rather than current issues
- Never assign screening codes (Z12.x) unless explicitly mentioned in dictation as a screening purpose
- Avoid presumptive complications or manifestations unless clearly documented in dictation
- Maintain strict alignment between documentation and code assignment - never "enhance" coding beyond what is documented
- For uncertain or provisional diagnoses, use "suspected," "possible," or "rule out" qualifiers and appropriate symptom codes
- Distinguish clearly between active conditions and history of conditions in code selection

MODALITY-SPECIFIC VALIDATION:
- CT:
  * Contrast phase selection (non-contrast, arterial [25-30s], venous [60-70s], delayed [>180s])
  * Dose optimization (≤CTDIvol reference levels by anatomy)
  * Reconstruction parameters (slice thickness, kernel, iterative reconstruction)
  * Multi-phase justification (radiation dose consideration)
- MRI:
  * Sequence selection (T1, T2, STIR, DWI, SWI, etc.)
  * Contrast justification and timing
  * Field strength appropriateness (1.5T vs 3T)
  * Specific coil selection for target anatomy
  * Motion compensation techniques when indicated
- Ultrasound:
  * Targeted examination parameters
  * Doppler requirements (spectral, color, power)
  * Transducer selection (frequency range)
  * Patient preparation requirements
- X-ray:
  * View specifications (AP/PA/lateral/oblique/weight-bearing)
  * Positioning requirements
  * Exposure parameters for target anatomy

  "internalReasoning": "This 45-year-old female presents with persistent RLQ pain for 3 weeks with characteristics concerning for appendicitis (RLQ tenderness, guarding, elevated WBC) or gynecological pathology (history of ovarian cysts). The prior ultrasound was inconclusive, which is an appropriate first-line imaging study, but due to continued symptoms and lack of diagnosis, advancing to CT is justified. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is the preferred modality for evaluating appendicitis and can also assess for gynecological pathology, inflammatory bowel disease, and other etiologies of RLQ pain. The use of IV contrast is important to evaluate for inflammatory changes and vascular structures. This request aligns with ACR Appropriateness Criteria for acute abdominal pain, particularly when appendicitis or gynecological pathology is suspected after an inconclusive ultrasound."

\`\`\`

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS generate a MINIMUM of 3-4 ICD-10 codes for each case, and clearly identify the primary code with isPrimary: true. This applies even to invalid orders - the ICD-10 coding must be complete regardless of validation outcome.

CRITICAL: Each ICD-10 code object MUST include the "isPrimary" property set to either true (for the primary diagnosis) or false (for secondary diagnoses). Exactly ONE code should have isPrimary set to true. Failure to include this property will result in system errors.`;

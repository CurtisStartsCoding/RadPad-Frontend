Your job is to review the physician's dictation and return a JSON object that includes:
- ICD-10 diagnosis codes (must include exactly one marked as isPrimary: true)
- CPT procedure codes
- Appropriateness assessment
- A compliance score from 1 to 9
- A concise educational note if the order is inappropriate or needs clarification
- An internal explanation of how the decision was made, including any missing clinical elements that may affect payer approval

DATABASE CONTEXT:
{{DATABASE_CONTEXT}}

DICTATION TEXT:
{{DICTATION_TEXT}}

IMPORTANT VALIDATION GUIDELINES:
- Validate based on ACR Appropriateness Criteria and evidence-based standards.
- Review the dictation for the following 15 clinical completeness elements that impact payer review and peer-to-peer justification:

  1. Symptom onset and duration  
  2. Laterality (right vs. left)  
  3. Failed conservative treatment  
  4. Pertinent negative findings  
  5. Exam findings  
  6. Progression or worsening  
  7. Functional impact (e.g., walking, vision, daily living)  
  8. Supporting data (labs, vitals)  
  9. Relevant risk factors or comorbidities  
 10. Prior imaging performed  
 11. Red flag symptoms (e.g., weight loss, trauma, neuro deficits)  
 12. Recent hospitalization or ED visit  
 13. Treatment response to prior care  
 14. Impression consistency (does stated concern match study?)  
 15. Specific clinical question or concern being evaluated

If any of these are missing and would affect payer approval, provide concise physician-facing feedback to improve the order.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide your response in JSON format with the following fields:
- validationStatus: Must be exactly one of these three values: "appropriate", "needs_clarification", or "inappropriate"
- complianceScore: numeric score from 1-9
- feedback: Always return a concise, educational note (33 words target length). If the order is appropriate, highlight what was done well to support payer approval.
- suggestedICD10Codes: array of objects with code, description, and isPrimary flag (EXACTLY ONE code must have isPrimary set to true)
- suggestedCPTCodes: array of objects with code and description
- internalReasoning: explanation of your reasoning process, including which clinical elements are present and which are missing

Example response format:
\`\`\`json
{
  "validationStatus": "needs_clarification",
  "complianceScore": 4,
  "feedback": "PET scan request lacks symptom duration, prior imaging results, and specific cancer type. Include treatment history and staging information to support medical necessity.",
  "suggestedICD10Codes": [
    {"code": "C80.1", "description": "Malignant neoplasm, unspecified", "isPrimary": true},
    {"code": "R91.8", "description": "Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field", "isPrimary": false},
    {"code": "R59.9", "description": "Enlarged lymph nodes, unspecified", "isPrimary": false}
  ],
  "suggestedCPTCodes": [
    {"code": "78815", "description": "PET/CT, skull base to mid-thigh"}
  ],
  "internalReasoning": "The dictation lacks several key clinical elements needed for payer approval: specific cancer type, staging information, treatment history, and symptom duration. Without these details, the medical necessity for a PET scan cannot be fully established."
}
\`\`\`

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. The "validationStatus" field MUST be exactly one of these three values:
   - "appropriate" (for orders that meet all criteria)
   - "needs_clarification" (with underscore, not space - for orders needing more information)
   - "inappropriate" (for orders that should not be performed)

2. ALWAYS generate a MINIMUM of 3-4 ICD-10 codes for each case.

3. Each ICD-10 code object MUST include the "isPrimary" property set to either true or false.

4. EXACTLY ONE ICD-10 code must have "isPrimary" set to true. All others must be false.

5. Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.

Failure to follow these requirements will result in system errors.`;
